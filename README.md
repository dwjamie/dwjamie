### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jamie Cao.

- I am a highly self-driven learner who **enjoys reading and writing** through platforms such as newsletters, Substack, Medium, WeChat public accounts, and Zhubai. I focus on topics including tech, AI, LLM, independent development, data science, product design, and personal growth.
- Outside of work, I am interested in **everything related to language**, such as stand-up comedy, podcasts, debates, and philosophy.
